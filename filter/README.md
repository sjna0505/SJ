I design and implement a program to perform simple kernel based image processing filters on an image. 
I implement three filters: 
1) the Sobel operator for edge detection (using a fixed sized kernel), 
2) the Gaussian blur filter for low-pass filtering, and 
3) unsharp mask filter for sharpening an image (which uses the Gaussian blur filter).
