I design and implement a program that behaves very similarly to your Mac/Linux terminal or Windows cmd.
Users can execute some basic commands to interact with a terminal such as 'cd' to change directory, 'rm' to delete a file or directory, 'mkdir' to create a directory, 'ls' to list all items in the current directory, etc.
I keep all data in memory and I donâ€™t actually read from or write to an actual file. 
I implemented with a doubly linked list.
