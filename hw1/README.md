Rational: I created a variety of overloaded operator functions in order to work for various kinds of expressions of multiplication, addition, and exponentiation. In addition, I added relational operator functions to compare between Rational objects as well as stream operators. I created a whole new function for handling signs of the Rational number in case the denominator was negative or both the numerator and the denominator were negative.


Reversi: I implemented the appropriate functions and constructors for Square, Board, Checkpoint, and Reversi. In Board, I had to create a copy constructor for adding checkpoints in Reversi, assignment operator for undo() in Reversi, and a destructor to deallocate all the memory that was created in the heap. In Reversi, I added other data members and helper functions in order to operate the game more smoothly.
